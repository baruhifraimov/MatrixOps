# SquareMat - Square Matrix Operations Library

## Project Overview

This project implements a square matrix class in C++ that supports various matrix operations. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, operator overloading, and memory management.

## Features

The `SquareMat` class supports:

- Matrix creation in various ways (empty, from array)
- Basic operations (+, -, *)
- Scalar operations (*, /, %)
- Special operations (determinant, transpose)
- Comparison operations (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Increment/decrement operations (++, --)
- Compound assignment operations (+=, -=, *=, etc.)

The `MatrixUtils` file delivering swap function, extracted outside of SquareMat for OOP purposes and future extensibility 
## How to Build and Run

The project includes a makefile with several targets:

- `make all`: Builds both the main program and tests
- `make Main`: Builds and runs the main program
- `make test`: Builds and runs the test suite
- `make valgrind`: Checks for memory leaks
- `make clean`: Cleans up build files

## Class Design

Implemented the `SquareMat` class with a dynamic 2D array to store matrix elements. To safely access matrix elements with bounds checking, I created a inner class for the `[][]` operation.

Matrix operations follow standard mathematical definitions. For example, matrix multiplication implements the standard row-by-column multiplication algorithm, and the determinant is calculated recursively.

## Testing

Used the doctest framework to create a comprehensive test suite that verifies:

- All operators work correctly
- Edge cases are handled properly
- Exceptions are thrown when expected (invalid dimensions, out-of-bounds access)
